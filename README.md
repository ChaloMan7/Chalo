# Holaaa

Welcome to my site 👋

I'm Gonzalo but go by Chalo. Currently I'm a Physical Therapist Assistant but wanting to get involved in the IT community as a Information Security Analist. 

I'm having so much fun in my learning process with coding that I sometimes I loss the sence of time 😎

I like to watch most sports. Specially, Chivas ⚽, Green Bay Packers 🏈, Bulls 🏀.

I like making Mexican food, specially discada tacos 🥩.

Thank you for stopping by 👋
